// The design of this library is to allow developers to use compaction and suballocation of
// acceleration structure buffers to reduce the memory footprint.  Compaction is proven to reduce the total memory
// footprint by more than a half.  Suballocation is proven to reduce memory as well by tightly packing
// acceleration structure buffers that are less than 64 KB.

// The intended use of this library is to batch up all of the acceleration structure build inputs and pass them to
// BuildAccelerationStructures which in turn will perform all the suballocation memory requests and build details
// including compaction.  Post build info is abstracted away by the library in order to do compaction under the hood.
// Following BuildAccelerationStructures execution on the GPU the call to CopyCompaction will receive an array of the
// ASBuffers provided by BuildAccelerationStructures and they will be compacted if requested.  ASBuffers will be modified
// with a valid compaction buffer GPUVA.  Once CopyCompaction has been executed on the GPU the request to release all
// unused resources with be performed by calling PostBuildRelease and passing in the ASBuffers array.
